Task and roles: Both of us working with preparing working environment. We installed IntelliJ IDEA, Maven and checked the correct version of Java. All that tips we did through Spring-boot tutorial, but we obtained one mistake, which was the same for both of us. The error
is: 
Failed to configure a DataSource: 'url' attribute is not specified and no embedded datasource could be configured.
Reason: Failed to determine a suitable driver class.
We were trying to do our best to solve that problem.

Task and roles: Our group meeting took place after the lecture.
During the lecture we asked teacher for the help with solving our problems, she gave us needed recommendations. 
Task for Olya: reinstall Java as she has a mismatch of Java versions, as spring-boot plugin cannot work properly.
The solution for the determination a suitable driver class is to fill 'application.properties' with an access to localhost and defining spring.datasource.driver-class-name=com.mysql.cj.jdbc.Driver.
